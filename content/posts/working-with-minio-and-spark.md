In this post, we'll explore how to use Minio and Spark together. Before jumping into Spark and MinIO let's first get a brief introduction to Spark and MinIO.

## Spark
Apache Spark is a fast and flexible open-source data processing engine that's used to process large datasets in parallel across a cluster of computers. 

Some of the benefits of Spark include its ability to handle large datasets quickly, its support for multiple programming languages, its ability to run on a variety of hardware and cloud platforms.

## MinIO
MinIO is a powerful, open-source object storage system that is designed for storing and accessing large amounts of unstructured data. 

One of the key benefits of MinIO is its versatility - it can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or even on a local machine as a data lake for developers. 

Other benefits of MinIO include its support for the Amazon S3 API, its compatibility with a wide range of applications and programming languages.
